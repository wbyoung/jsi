  <h1>Test Driven Development</h1>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>What is it?</h2>
  <p>Let's break it down.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>What are tests?</h2>
  <p>Tests verify that your code works properly.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>How do you create tests?</h2>
  <p>Well, you write more code.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>A function to test</h2>
  <pre><code class="javascript" data-trim>
/**
 * Calculate the difference between two numbers
 * @param {number} a - The first number
 * @param {number} b - The second number
 * @returns {number} The difference between a and b
 */
var difference = function(a, b) {
  // calculate difference here
};
  </code></pre>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>What should we test?</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Standard uses</li>
    <li>Corner cases (unusual uses)</li>
  </ul>
  <aside class="notes">
    Corner cases are sometimes difficult to think of as they
    occur using unusual or unexpected input. What might
    a corner case be for a square-root function? Negative
    numbers.

<section>
  <h2>A test</h2>
  <pre><code class="javascript" data-trim>
var result = difference(5, 2);
expect(result).to.eql(3);
  </code></pre>
  <p>What do you think this does?</p>
</section>

<section>
  <section>
    <h2>Tools</h2>
    <h3>Mocha and Chai</h3>
    <p><small>Programmers have run out of descriptive names.</small></p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <p>Chai.js gives us natural language to express expectations.</p>
    <pre><code class="javascript" data-trim>
var result = difference(5, 2);
expect(result).to.eql(3);
    </code></pre>
    <p>Expressing an expectation is called an <em>assertion</em>.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <p>Mocha allows us to group tests</p>
    <pre><code class="javascript" data-trim>
describe('difference()', function() {
  it('returns a positive number when the first argument is greater', function() {
    var result = difference(5, 2);
    expect(result).to.eql(3);
  });
  it('returns a positive number when the second argument is greater', function() {
    var result = difference(2, 4);
    expect(result).to.eql(2);
  });
});
    </code></pre>
    <p>You'll see shortly how this all ties together nicely.</p>

    <h2>Driving Development</h2>
    <p>Remember, it's called Test Driven Development.</p>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h2>Workflow</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Write a test</li>
      <li>Run test and make sure it fails</li>
      <li>Write the actual code</li>
      <li>Run test again to see that it passes</li>
      <li>Repeat</li>
    </ul>
    <aside class="notes">
      This process is known as the red/green/refactor cycle.

  <h2>Buzzwords</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Unit Tests</li>
    <li>Functional Tests</li>
    <li>Integration Tests</li>
    <li>End to End Tests</li>
    <li>Acceptance Tests</li>
    <li>BDD, Behavior Driven Development</li>
    <li>Agile development</li>
  </ul>
  <aside class="notes">
    <p>The lines between different testing terms can be fuzzy. Some people are very passionate about the differences.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Unit - typically tests a single function, simple</li>
      <li>Functional - solely checks that result is correct, state/side effects not considered</li>
      <li>Integration - tests systems together, could include db/disk</li>
      <li>Acceptance - plain English tests, describes using full system</li>
      <li>BDD - focus on behavior, the conversation around behavior, and terminology like given, should and scenarios</li>
      <li>Agile - most shops do something like this, includes TDD, short iteration cycles</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      There's a good <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/4904533/98069">answer</a> on StackOverflow about the difference
      between some of these terms.
