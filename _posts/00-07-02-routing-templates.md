It's time to learn more Ember!

If you haven't already started looking into routing and templates, try to get
through those two topics today.

Make sure you can answer the following questions:

- What is a route?
- When are routes used?
- What causes Ember to change the current route?
- How do you create a new route?
- How can you customize the behavior of a route?
- What is the association between routes and templates?
- What does it mean for routes to be nested within resources?

You should be able to:

- Create an application with multiple routes
- Create links that allow you to transition between routes
- Provide data from a route that can be used by the template
- Make a template that displays an array of data
