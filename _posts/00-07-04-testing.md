It's time to learn more Ember!

If you haven't already started looking into testing, take a look today.

Testing with Mocha, Chai, and Karma will require a bit of setup. Fortunately,
you can set this up very easily with [Caribou][caribou]. Also, the unit test
helpers won't work with Mocah, but there's another way you can isolate pieces
of an application for testing.

Make sure you can answer the following questions:

- What's required to set up a testing environment?
- How does Ember deal with asynchronous testing?

You should be able to:

- Write tests for user interaction.
- Write unit tests.

If your group is a little ahead of schedule, let's discuss how you might
structure testing an application where the front end is using a back-end API.
