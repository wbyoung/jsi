Today we're going to start learning Node.js. There's a great interactive
tutorial from [nodeschool.io][nodeschool] called
[`learnyounode`][learnyounode].

    npm install -g learnyounode
    learnyounode

You can skip around in this. Some of the exercises do build on previous ones,
but don't get too caught up in some of the earlier exercises. You've already
learned most of the material through the exercise on modules.

Make sure you do the HTTP file server exercise.

## HTTP Servers

Node allows us to easily build applications built on top of HTTP. You've
learned the basics, now write a server that can:

- Serve HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files out of a `public` directory.
- Serve `index.html` if a directory is requested.
- Return `404` errors when a page is not found.
- Make `/` redirect to `/home/`.
- Finally, add a JSON API for an address book.

The JSON API should expose the following resources:

- `GET /api/people` return a list of people.
- `POST /api/people` should add a new person.
- `GET /api/people/1` should return a specific person.
- `PUT /api/people/1` should update a person.
- `DELETE /api/people/1` should remove a person.

People should have a `firstName`, `lastName`, and `address`. For now, you
should store the people in a standard JavaScript structure. This means they'll
be stored in memory, and every time you restart your server, your list of
people will revert back to being empty (or a pre-set value). We'll improve this
when we discuss persistence.

Your directory structure should start like this:

    /server.js
    /public/index.html
    /public/js/application.js
    /public/css/application.css
