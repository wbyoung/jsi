## Class Flow

- Run through slides
- 
- When you get to the command line apps and handling arguments, the students
  should read through the code first. This will be their first exercise in
  reading longer code and/or a code base that they didn't write. Explain that
  they should try to figure things out, maybe even get it running and see what
  different pieces do by logging.
  The first new piece here will be the slice call on `process.argv`. Make sure
  they understand that after reading it.
  It also involves a switch statement which they haven't seen before. See if
  they can figure out what this does on their own. Allow them to discuss with a
  partner and search the Internet. Give them a few minutes to do this, then
  explain switch statements, fall-through cases, and show them the equivalent
  if/else structure.
  Also, this is the first time that `%s` has been used in a string instead of
  concatenating with `+`. Be sure to point that out.
