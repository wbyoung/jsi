TODO: Jumping into the command line as one of the first things we did made
some people feel uncomfortable, but others were already ready for it and had
pretty much done all of those commands.

TODO: `mkdir -p /usr/local/bin` resulted in needing to
`sudo mkdir -p /usr/local/bin` as well as
<code>sudo chown \`whoami\` /usr/local/bin</code>.

TODO: People who are renting Macs feel a little uncomfortable on the platform.

TODO: Somehow indicate during the challenge (either verbally or in the text for
it) that each part should be taken one at a time.

TODO: Better incorporate impostor syndrome into everything somehow.

TODO: JavaScript in the browser introduced some stuff like AJAX that may not
have been the best to explore. Asking the students is both good and bad. It
allows us to get a glimpse into their understanding, but also makes it possible
to confuse fellow classmates. This is a necessary risk.

## Class Flow

- Class starts with slides. It'd be good to break out of the slides pretty
  often to give examples of things on the slides. Also, the students should
  follow along while going through the slides.
- Note that students should avoid working ahead. The course contents is
  designed for presentation by an instructor and has a lot of places where it
  would be easy to get lost. If extra projects are desired, ask, and we'll
  happily provide some more stuff to work on.
- During the project, point out that some people may be coming in with slightly
  different backgrounds. For those who have programmed before, this may feel
  easy. For those who haven't, it may feel difficult. Everyone should be
  understanding of the varying levels of ability at this point, and no one
  should feel that they missed anything prior to the start of class just
  because someone else happens to be ahead.
- If not everyone finishes the project in a decent amount of time, stop
  everyone and work on it together. Try to get the group that's the furthest
  behind to answer questions about what we should write next.

### Teamwork

- Students are going to be split into teams of 2 for the first week. They'll
  be have new partners assigned during weeks 2, 3, and 4.
- It is therefore in each student's best interest to ensure that everyone in
  the class move at the same speed. If a group feels that they're ahead of
  everyone else, they should take some time to help some other groups. They
  should not give other groups the answer. They should simply help answer
  questions. If groups don't move at the same speed, the class will become
  unbalanced. This will happen to some extent, but we'd like to try to avoid
  it.
- Students will work in groups of 2-3 for the second month. The groups will be
  different for the first two and the second two weeks.
- For the last month, students will submit requests on who to work with for
  their final projects. Groups will be 2-4 in size. They should include a
  reason they want to work with each of their top choices (or a project they've
  already discussed). The instructor should place students into groups ensuring
  that groups feel balanced. Putting all of the best students together will not
  result in a realistic environment. But the best student paired with the
  weakest student would result in frustration for both. Personality and how
  well the students worked together in the past should be considered.

### Notes on Learning

- Students should write down questions as they come up. Carrying a small
  notebook around with them could be a good idea.
- Everyone should try to come up with at least one question from the previous
  day's class to start off the following day.
- Discuss constructive criticism & non-constructive criticism. Throughout the
  class you'll probably be critical as an instructor, but this is to help them
  grow.
- No programmer knows everything. A sign of strength and a great way to learn
  is to admit that you don't know what someone else is talking about.
- Solutions to many exercises will be available either directly on this site or
  by quickly searching on the internet. Students should use those as resources
  and tools for learning and not abuse them. Students should respect others'
  learning styles and not offer up solutions when they simply read it.
- Discuss impostor syndrome.
  If you don't feel that you've ever been affected by impostor syndrome
  yourself, at least share with students the fact that after X years of
  learning to program, you're still learning. Have empathy.
- This curriculum sometimes intentionally takes big steps. The idea is to allow
  students to also grow through exploration as they will be required to do on
  the job. Re-assure the students that even when that happens, we're here to
  guide and answer questions.

#### Cheating

We're all adults, but a cheating student will hurt everyone in the class. This
is worth point out to them. Also, all the notes that the instructor uses for
the classes are available online with full solutions. Eventually they'll know
enough to find them (if they don't already today). Point this out and request
that they respect everyone in the class by not reading the instructor notes.


## Project

- Expected questions for the project include how to keep line breaks when using
  one `console.log` statement. There's a good chance that they won't know the
  term line break.
